Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in which it occurs. 

All TensorFlow forums and spaces are meant for professional interactions, and any behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.


## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all content on tensorflow.org, TensorFlowâ€™s GitHub organization, or any other official TensorFlow web presence allowing for community interactions, as well as at all official TensorFlow events, whether offline or online.

The Code of Conduct also applies within project spaces and in public spaces whenever an individual is representing TensorFlow or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed or de facto representative at an online or offline event. 


## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.

If the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires immediate escalation, please see below.

However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. 

If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following escalation strategy to address the conflict:

1. Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a real-time medium. 
2. If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with background on the issue, but not involved in conflict) to intercede.
3. If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.

## Reporting Violations

Violations of the Code of Conduct can occur in any setting, even those unrelated to the project. We will only consider complaints about conduct that has occurred within one year of the report.


## Enforcement

If the Project Stewards receive a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, the Project Stewards will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The Project Stewards will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the Project Stewards may issue sanctions without notice.
